## Arrays

The Factory utility can also handle arrays of entities. You can specify an array of a certain entity in the `@FactoryRelationField` decorator.

```typescript
class Product {
  @FactoryRelationField(() => [Review])
  reviews: Review[];
}
```

Then, you can create an instance of the main entity, and the Factory utility will automatically create an array of instances of the related entity.

```typescript
const factory = new Factory(faker);
const product = factory.new(Product, {
  reviews: [3],
});
```

You can also specify the instances of array relationships

```typescript
const factory = new Factory(faker);
const product = factory.new(Product, {
  reviews: [1],
});
```
