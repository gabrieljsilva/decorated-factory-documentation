## Difference between "new" and "create"

The `new` method of the Factory utility creates a new instance of a class, while the `create` method creates an instance of the `Overridable` class that wraps the original instance. The `Overridable` class provides a `override` method that allows you to override the values of the instance.

```typescript
const factory = new Factory(faker);
const overridable = factory.create(Product);
const product = overridable.override(() => ({ name: 'Hello World' }));
```

In this example, the `name` field of the `Product` instance will be 'Hello World', regardless of the function provided in the `@FactoryField` decorator.

## Overriding

The `Overridable` class provides a way to override the values of an instance. You can use the `override` method and provide a function that returns an object with the fields to override. The function receives the current instance as a parameter.

```typescript
const overridable = factory.create(Product);
const product = overridable.override((instance) => ({
  name: 'New Name',
}));
```

In this example, the `name` field of the `Product` instance will be 'New Name', regardless of the function provided in the `@FactoryField` decorator.

## Creating Lists of Entities

The Factory utility provides methods to create lists of entities, which can be useful for generating data for testing collections or arrays of objects.

### newList Method

The `newList` method allows you to create a list of new instances of a class.

```typescript
const factory = new Factory(faker);
const amount = 3;
const products = factory.newList(Product, amount);
expect(products).toHaveLength(amount);
```

### createList Method

The `createList` method allows you to create a `Overridable` instance of generated objects, which can then be overridden as needed.

```typescript
const factory = new Factory(faker);
const amount = 3;
const overridable = factory.createList(Product, amount);
expect(overridable).toBeInstanceOf(Overridable);
```
