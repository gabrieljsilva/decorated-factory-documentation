# Decorated Factory
A factory decorators for creating objects with faker data

## Purpose

Decorated Factory is a tool for creating instances of classes, especially useful in testing scenarios where you need to generate data.

It uses decorators to define how to generate data for each field of a class, also supports relationships between entities and arrays of entities.

This project was inspired by the way queries are made in PrismaORM.
