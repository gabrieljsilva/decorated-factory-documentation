## Usage

### Basic Usage
To use the Factory utility, you first need to define a class and use the `@FactoryField` decorator to specify how to generate data for each field. The decorator takes a function that receives a `faker` instance and returns the generated data.


```typescript
class Product {
  @FactoryField((faker) => faker.number.int())
  id: number;

  @FactoryField((faker) => faker.commerce.productName())
  name: string;
}
```
> PS: the faker is not imported in the production bundle, because the decorator import only the faker type.


Then, you can use the Factory utility to create instances of this class.

```typescript
const factory = new Factory(faker);
const product = factory.new(Product);
```
